# axis-periphery

This repository contains non-core contracts from the Axis Finance system.

## Developer Guide

Axis is built in Solidity using Foundry as the development and test environment. The following commands are available for development:

### First-Run

```shell
pnpm install
```

### Build

```shell
forge build
```

### Test

The test suite can be run with:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

#### Address Mismatch

Many of the contracts (e.g. callbacks) require a specific address prefix or have a deterministic address. If tests are failing for this reason, the cause is usually one of:

- The code of a callback contract has been changed
  - This requires re-generating the salt for the contract. See the [test_salts.sh](/script/salts/test/test_salts.sh) script.
- There has been a change to the dependencies under `/lib`. The dependencies affect the build output, so any changes will affect the bytecode generated by the Solidity compiler.
  - If the submodule change was inadvertent, this can be fixed by running `pnpm install` to reset the changes.
  - In some cases, such as the `g-uni-v1-core` dependency, installing npm packages will result in the remappings being changed. It is best to remove the dependency's respective dependencies in order to fix this.
  - If the change to dependencies and invalidation of salts is expected, then new salts must be generated. In some cases (such as Uniswap V2 and V3 factories), the new addresses must be recorded in the `Constants.sol` file.

### Format

Combines `forge fmt` and `solhint`

```shell
pnpm run lint
```

To run linting on all files (including tests and scripts):

```shell
pnpm run lint:all
```

### Scripts

Scripts are written in Solidity using Foundry and are divided into `deploy`, `salts` and `ops` scripts. Specific scripts are written for individual actions and can be found in the `scripts` directory along with shell scripts to run them.

### Deployments

Deployments are listed in the [env.json file](/script/env.json) and periodically updated in the [Axis documentation](https://axis.finance/developer/reference/contract-addresses).

### Dependencies

[soldeer](https://soldeer.xyz/) is used as the dependency manager, as it solves many of the problems inherent in forge's use of git submodules. Soldeer is integrated into `forge`, so should not require any additional installations.

### Packaging

To publish a new package version to soldeer, run the following:

```shell
pnpm run publish <version>
```

On first run, this requires authentication with soldeer: `soldeer login`

The [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file should also be updated.
